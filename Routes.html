            <p>We make our way to Betws-Y-Coed, and then take the back roads and country lanes to Capel Curig. We then head towards Snowden (Yr Wyddfa) which looms in the distance (subject to good weather!). At the Llanberis turn, we descend on the southern side of Snowdon and ride into Beddgelert where there are multiple cafes. If you have time, visit Gelert's grave and read about this fable. This route then follows the Welsh Highland Railway line and the spectacular river down to Nantmoor, where we leave the main road and head to Garreg. Shortly after Garreg you will see the RSPB site which may have a viewing gallery for nesting Ospreys (if they return this year). At Tremadog you could take a short excursion into Porthmadog.

The climb is worth it for the spectacular views across Hells Mouth to Sarn-Bach and the long descent to the beautiful remote village of Aberdaron.
